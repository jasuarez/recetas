Ingredientes:
    Main:
        - 1 cup of delicate oat flakes
        - 1 banana
        - 1 tbsp of cocoa powder
        - Warm water
    Optional:
        - 2 tbsp of ground almonds
  
Pasos:
    - Mash the banana in the deep dish. And blah blah blah, but more blah blha
      except by you.
    - Add the remaining ingredients.
    - Pour over some hot Water - Bon appetit!

Notas: This is a basic recipe example for an everyday breakfast oatmeal. The banana provides a naturally slight sweetness and the almonds valuable fats and proteins. The cocoa supplements with intense flavor and superfood character. Try using grated coconut instead of ground almonds or cinnamon instead of cocoa powder.
